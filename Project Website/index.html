	<h4>Project Abstract</h4>
	Text mining made important advances in methods to convert vast and unstructured text data into knowledge. 
        However, the current paradigm of relationship extraction has one major limitation: it models snapshots of 
	information but fails to capture the fundamentally dialogic and dynamic nature of knowledge: conflicting 
	findings, inconsistent discoveries, refutations, contradictions, reinforcements or confirmations, all 
	changing over time. This project aims to capture such fundamental dynamics of knowledge, specifically 
	focusing on causal relationships. Whereas numerous articles, including academic articles, present 
	knowledge and relationships that express causality, such relationships are not static and can change 
	over time due to changing conditions. The objective of this project is to identify cues of causal 
	knowledge from text data, quantify the strength of the causal relationship, and model its dynamics 
	over changing conditions. Ultimately, the project aims at modelling a more holistic view of the 
	knowledge extracted from text. As text data is extensively used by researchers and practitioners 
	from different domains of national importance, including, medicine and health, economics, public 
	policy, journalism, the results of this project seek to provide the foundation to offer practitioners 
	new ways to understand the evolving nature of the causal relationships present in large text datasets. 
	Specifically, the novel approaches developed in the project will be applied to explore public health 
	data to determine how changing climatic, political, economic conditions may affect the mental and 
	physical health of the population in different geographic areas. In addition, there will be various 
	educational activities as part of this project - emerging and related topics from this project will 
	be included in the curricula of various courses in the applied data science master's program; promote 
	undergraduate research, specifically, recruit students to work in the project who are from 
	underrepresented and economically disadvantaged communities; organize a research workshop to 
	encourage participation of high school students in STEM research.
	<br><br>
The project activities include the development of a novel model of causal relationship extraction that leverages a unified deep learning framework combining both semantic and syntax cues. This approach will utilize the key syntactical features of a sentence represented by the grammar relationships between noun, verbs and other parts of speech through graphical or tree-like models. This work will determine whether the sentence features a structure that signals causality. Moreover, the sequential component of the model will utilize the semantics and identify the influence of certain words in the sentence to characterize the nature of the causal relationship expressed in the text. This task will capture the strength of the relationship (e.g., using cues like "extremely likely", "definitely"), any supporting or opposing evidences (e.g., "will lead to" or "does not lead to"), and will identify conditional cues (e.g., "in the presence of") etc. Quantifying such qualitative properties will lead to the second innovation of this project ? causal distance. Causal distance is a time-variant metric that will denote the magnitude of causality between two entities as well as capture the dynamism of the relationship by modifying itself over time with changing conditions or new evidences. Collectively, the advances pursued in this projects will further enhance our understanding of the novel computational approaches needed to unearth and reason on cues of causal relationships embedded in large text data sets. The outcomes of this project, such as datasets, source code, final software, results and publications will be shared via publicly accessible URLs and online code repositories. Additionally, all the project resources and outcomes will be made available on the project website.

<!--<h2>Extraction of (Key,Value) Pairs from Unstructured Ads</h2>
This  work  is about the  problem  of  extract-
ing structured labeled data from short unstructured ad-
postings  from  online  sources  like  Craigslist,  where
ads  are  posted  on  various  topics,  such  as  job  post-
ings, rentals, car sales etc. A fundamental challenge in
addressing  this  problem  is  that  most  ad-postings  are
highly  unstructured,  short-text  postings  written  in  an
informal  manner  with  no  inherent  grammar  or  well-
defined dictionary. We used  unsuper-
vised  and  supervised  algorithms  for  extracting  struc-
tured  data  from  unstructured  ads  in  the  form  of  (key,
value)  pairs  where  the
keys
naturally  represent  topic-
specific features in the ads. The unsupervised algorithm
is centered around building an affinity graph, using the
words from a topic-specific corpus of such ads where
the  edge  weights  represent  affinities  between  words;
the (key, value) extraction algorithm identifies specific
groups of words in the affinity graph corresponding to
different  classes  of  key  attributes.  The  supervised  al-
gorithm uses a Conditional Random Field based train-
ing algorithm to identify specific structured (key, value)
pairs based on pre-defined topic-specific structural data
representations  of  ads.
